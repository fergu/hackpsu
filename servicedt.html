				<h2>Dentures - Partial/Full</h2>
<h3>Dentures or Removable artificial teeth set</h3>
						
			                                <p> When many of your teeth are loose or painful, you may have passed the point 

where you can save them. This is usually caused by advanced periodontal 

disease. Periodontal disease causes bone to be lost, and if it's not caught in 

time, there's so little support for the teeth they have to be removed. Removing 

your teeth and replacing them with a denture may be the best way to eliminate 

the infection and restore the health of your mouth.</p>
<p>&quot; I am resigned to getting partial dentures. I realise they are uncomfortable, but what I do fear 

more than the pain of removal, is the return to work. Will I sound like Daffy Duck? Are they 

horribly uncomfortable? I know I need them, but I am concerned. &quot;,</p>
<p> You will be surprised by how well you get on with the dentures. Millions of people 

have them and cope very well. Some useful tips and advice are as follows:</p>
<p>1. It can take about one week for every decade old you are to get used to new 

dentures. It is important not to panic if they feel loose when you first get them- they 

should tighten up when they settle. Also your mouth learns to control them but this 

takes time.</p>
<p>2. Often they will rub the gums a bit at first, meaning that they need to be adjusted by 

the dentist &#45  so if you get an ulcer, this does not mean that you cannot or will not be 

able to wear them &#45 just call the dentist!</p>
<p>3. When you first get them talk to the plants/pets etc as much as possible to get used to 

talking with them in.</p>
<p>4. Practice counting from 65 up to 70 as these sounds can be the hardest to get used 

to. Remember that your tongue and cheeks etc. are suddenly being asked to move in 

a different way- give them a chance to learn!!</p>
<p>5. You should usually take them out at night- but keep them in for the first 1 or 2, as this 

will let your mouth get used to them being there. (You might find them in the sheets 

in the morning though!). Keeping them in for the first 24 hours also helps if you have 

had teeth taken out as it ensures that the gums heal in the best way.</p>
<p>6. It is common for people to salivate more (which can affect speech) when they first get

a denture &#45 basically because the mouth thinks that the plates are big gob-stoppers!!! 

Its not very often that a dentist will advise you to have sweets but it helps to have 

something like boiled sweets or mints (try to get SUGAR-FREE!!) for the first few 

hours of wearing your new plates. When you finish the sweet the salivation should 

naturally decrease and the mouth will not think that your dentures are food also!</p>
<p>7. It sounds like you are getting immediate dentures (i.e. teeth extracted and the plates 

fitted on the same day). You will probably need the dentures relined, or new ones 

made in about 3 months. This is because the dentures are made as a &lsquo; guess &rsquo;, of what 

the gums will be like after the teeth come out. So if you do feel that you are struggling 

a bit, things WILL be improved upon in 3 months.</p>

                                <h3>Removable Partial dentures or Removable teeth set

of only a few teeth</h3>
                                         <p>An upper partial denture can be a good way to replace missing teeth. When 

you save your remaining teeth and have a partial denture, you'll chew better, 

look better, and have a healthier mouth. The metal clasps fit around the anchor 

teeth and hold the partial in place. A partial denture prevents several problems. 

By filling in spaces, it stops neighboring teeth from shifting. When missing 

teeth aren't placed, it can set off a chain reaction that can result in cavities and 

periodontal disease. It also helps balance your bite. This means you'll chew 

better and have a healthier jaw joint. Partials also add support to your cheeks 

and lips. This support is necessary to speak clearly and look your best. Some 

temporary problems are a normal part of adjusting to your new partial denture. 

At first, it may tip when you chew. You may notice increased salivary flow. It 

may seem bulky. You may gag a little. Your tongue will feel crowded, and you 

may have difficulty speaking. But don't worry. As you get used to your new 

partial, these problems will go away. With time and practice, you'll make the 

adjustment and be eating with confidence.</p>
