				<h2>Tooth Bleaching and Whitening</h2>
						
			                                <p> &#45 Bleaching or Teeth Whitening will lighten teeth in around 80% cases. Teeth that tend to yellow are easiest to lighten.</p>
							<p> &#45 Bleaching in adults causes little, if any, discomfort.</p>
							<p> &#45 Bleaching live or vital teeth involves coating the outside of the teeth with a chemical solution -the oxidizing agent- and exposing them to heat or light for 20-30 minutes.</p>
							<p> &#45 Teeth can be bleached even if their nerves have been removed as in the case with Root Canal Therapy . In fact such teeth referred by dentists as non-vital or pulpless teeth are easier to bleach than vital teeth.One method of Bleaching these teeth involves reopening the canal which previously contained nerves, placing a bleaching solution inside and re-sealing the canal with a temporary filling. The bleaching process continues until the agent is removed and can be repeated until the satisfactory lightening takes place.</p>

				<h3>Home Bleaching</h3>

						Home bleaching also called matrix bleaching or nightguard vital bleaching, is a convenient and cost effective way.
            				</p>
            				<p> &#45
						It involves filling a plastic tray with a bleaching solution or gel and wearing it for a few hours each day or overnight.
            				</p>
            				<p> &#45

                                         <p> &#45

                                        <p> &#45

					</p>
                                        <p> &#45
						The results are visible after one to two sessions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> &#45
                                        	These days special bleaching systems using patented gels and lights can give instant results.

                                         <p> &#45
						In certain cases where the discoloration is more or for some deep seated stains like tetracycline, combination whitening may be required where in few session of in-office bleaching are followed up by home bleaching or vice versa.
